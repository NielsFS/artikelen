# What makes good web design?

As a webdeveloper, it is very important that the things that you build have a certain design incorporated in to it that complement and enhance the experience of the user. But what makes good web design? Right of the bat i am able to tell you that there is not an accurate definition of what good design entails. Design is something that is ever evolving. Not only is it evolving due to the continually improving web technologies, it is also evolving along user tastes and the experiences that a user expects to get from a digital webpage, app or product. It is however possible to incorporate certain design fundamentals into your webprojects that will lead to better user experience.

## Tailor your design to your consumers needs

Every company wants its digital presence to stand out from that of its competitors. But doing so is no easy feet. As tastes and needs greatly differ among consumers, who do you actually tailor your experience to? Currently it is immensly popular for businesses to pinpoint their consumers by defining their "target audience". Sounds like a good idea, right? Well, that is actually not such a great thing to do. Tailoring your brand to one or several target audiences does make defining your brand easier. However, it greatly limits the shaping of a brand. How can you create a unique experience when you are mostly trying to appeal to certain categories of people? There is a greatly more effective way of appealing to certain audiences. Define _what_ it is that your company is improving and what _user needs_ it is solving. Your users nowadays cannot be truly defined by their age, occupancy or wether they have a partner or not. An elderly person can nowadays just as easily start its internet banking plan as a graduate stundent. By uniquely solving a consumers need in the way that you see fit is therefore much more effective. Make sure to tailor your design to these specific consumers needs. Be original! Dare to stand out. But keep in mind that you must make it as easy as possible to your consumer to understand what it is that you are solving for them and make sure it is easy for them to get to it. By doing so you create your own target audience where you can stand out by your own custom identity.

## Do not overdo it (usually)

You might be a great desiner with some great frontend skills. Perhaps you have mastered the art of cool transitions, are able to create cool and complex navigations are not shy of using some complex color schemes to create a crazy cool looking website. To you this might seem like a great idea, but as a designer your view of what is great user experience may greatly differ from what a consumer expects your webpage or app should deliver. On the website www.awwwards.com you might be able to get a sense of what I mean by that. The website is an online contest where webdevelopers and designers show off their intricate and complex designs, wich do look quite cool in al lot of occasions. However trying to navigate these websites is often a total nightmare. Every designer tries to take its own approach of navigating a user through the webpage or webapplication which not always leads to a great experience. Words and navigation links are often scattered accross the screen. Some layed out horizontal, some layed out vertical. Moving your mouse over the screen leads to all kinds of transitions, animations and other shenanigans. True, this is great way to show off your skill, but it is often just terrible user experience. I like to call them headache websites. Therefore my reccomendation is to not overuse unorthodox layouts and transition. Use them sparcely, and only to create seemless transitions between your core content. By doing you don't overwhelm your consumer but still make them appreciate the technicallity of your website. 

## Do not dismiss conventional webdesign practices as being "overused" or "too basic" too easily

Picture this. You are on vacation and you have brought some great books to read. You might have brought a nice novel, a thriller and an interesting historical book to pass some quality time in the shade. These books differ greatly in content. The historical book might have some great pictures to enhance the story while the novel relies on some strong and well written chapters. Even though these books differ greatly in content, you are able to read them just as easily as other books. This is because the books are structured in a conventional way that have become core practice. It ensures that the user instinctively knows where to look. You know here the headers are, you know where you are able to find the pagination and you are easily able to look something up in its table of contents at the start of the book. To me, the core of good webdesign is making sure that the people looking at your webpage instinctively know where to find the content they are looking for. Nobody is interested in your funky looking drop down menu if they aren't able to properly find it and use it to navigate to the content they are looking for.

## The design principles of Joshua Porter

Last but not least, make sure that you are aware of the principles of design that are known to enhance the usability, readability and user experience of (online) content.
