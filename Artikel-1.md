# My first delve into actual coding

Last February of 2018 i started the minor Web Development at the CMD, which is part of the University of Amsterdam's "Communication and Multimedia Design" studies. When I started out, I was a total noob to coding. I applied to the minor not because i was confident that I would be able to make it through the minor, but because I was intrested in learning more about coding and webdevelopment.

When I started out, the only things I had made was a simple Wordpress website (which looked quite terrible to be fair), a simple HTML and css page, and.. that was it. You could say that I was well in over my head when i started the minor, as it wasn't really an "entry level" coding minor. The first three weeks of the minor were therefore quite daunting. We started out with two subjects: Web App From Scratch and CSS to the Rescue. Within these first couple weeks, I had to familiarize myself with CSS and JavaScript. Apart from that, I had to learn how to work with GitHub, had to know how my code editor worked, how basic folder structure worked and many other things. 

To my surprise there were only two people in the minor that came from a different study: I and some other guy. Immediately we had a mutual understanding: we where the noobs of the class and it would be wise to team up and tackle this together. The other guy was quite positively spirited about the minor. I felt the same, however I also felt that I understood that getting through the minor would be quite a challenge. He didn't seem to understand that. It was also very surprising that he didn't even know some basics of HTML an CSS. Zero preparation whatsoever. His optimism was however really funny, in a positive way. He did drop out after the first couple weeks though. 

Because of him dropping out, I kind of felt that I too was perhaps being too optimistic; I didn't pass my first two subjects. However, I did have a sense that I was really learning and growing. The optimism did not leave me. I figured that even if I didn't pass any of the subjects, I still could learn a lot from just trying. I obviously didn't pass the Javascript subject. However, i got a 5 for the CSS subject, so close to passing! The CSS subject was really a confidence booster. Within just three weeks I had learnt how to style all sorts of elements and components. The page actually looked pretty cool too. It made use of flexbox, grid, a cool navigation bar and many other CSS tinkerings. It really gave me the feeling that by just trying, i would be able to accomplish quite a lot. 

So those where my first couple weeks into actual coding. I was actually able to pass quite a lot of the subjects. I passed all the designing subjects, passed the special project weeks and right now I am steadily improving my Javascript to finish the more technical subjects as well. Even though I might not pass all of the subjects and finish the minor, I already kind of feel that I have accomplished my goal. And that, to me, is great.
