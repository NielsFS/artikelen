# Creating webexperiences for those you tend to forget about

When making websites it is easy to forget that your page may be used by people you would not think of being able to do so. I feel like i had the privilege to see for myself how people with disabilities are much more capable than one might think of. During my minor webdevelopment, I was able to see both a blind person and a spastic person navigate websites. Before I had seen them in actrion, i honestly would not have thought that they were actually quite able to use and navigate online media. let alone that they relied on those media on a daily basis. 

## How a blind person navigates a website

At first it might be quite hard to imagine what a blind person would be able to do with a computer. He is unable to llok at photo's of cats and is unable to see the latest memes. Luckily there is a lot more to do on a computer than that. Using a screen reader, a blind person is able to have a page read out to him. Not only webpage content, also navigation links and all kind sof other important information displayed on a screen. A blind person is also able to hook up a braille reading device to his computer. Text on a computer is then automatically being translated to braille. 

One important premise for the text being read out in voice speech or in braille is that the webpage is semantically correct. Even though a webpage may look right from a sighted persons view, for a blind person it can easily be a mess. And unfortunately, this is often the case. Screen readers rely on a certain order and iportancy of webpages. For example, the h1 header element gets read before the lesser important h4, h5 and h6 elements. Therefore if you decide to style important headings with h6's, the pages becomes quite difficult to read for a blind person. Same goes for navigation links. If you use semantically incorrect elements to style your navigation bar and toggle menu's a lot of vital information can be left out. 

## How a physically impaired person navigates a website

Unlike blind people, physically impaired people are for the most part able to properly see a webpage. The difficulty however lies in being able to use the regular navigation keys and mouse. For example, a spasctic person may have a very hard time clicken on a button using his mouse or touchpad. Another common problem with websites is that they cannot be properly navigated with the arrow keys and tab key on a keyboard. if semantically incorrect elemtns are being used, the whole focus property may never be applied and making a website very hard to navigate for an impaired person. 

## Be mindful of impaired people that also want to enjoy the internet

Mostly when websites are inaccessible, it is due to parts of it not being properly structured. To you as a webdeveloper with sight and proper functioning hands this might not seem as a problem, but in fact you are excluding a lot of people from accessing your website. By simply paying close attention to making sure that you properly structure your html, you are able to get rid of a lot of website inaccessibilities. Not only will your site be working better, you will also improve some peoples quality of life. And that should be plenty of enough reason to be mindful.
