# The usefulness of semantically correct code

As a developer you can easily be lured into writing semantically incorrect code. Throwing divs all around the place, Dressing divs up as buttons and trying to make the wrong element do what you want to achieve, while there was actually a proper HTML element that you should have used. Diabeling defaults and slapping elements around the place with Javascript. These are the things that most likely any beginning developer has encountered. At first you might defend these insemantic choices. For Example: "there was no other way to do it", or: "it is a bit hacky, but nobody will tell the difference!". However, there are numerous reasons why you want to avoid this behavior at all times.

### It will save you time

Writing semantically incorrect code is ofthen the cause of wanting to get something done quickly. And this can lead to falling into numerous pits which will cause you to write semantically incorrect code. Instead of doing the needed research into the write elements and code that you need for your project, its easy to start writing code rightaway. It may seem like you are making a lot og progress, but you'll soon discover the flaws in your code which often lies in the base of your code structure. The later you'll discover these flaws, the more time consuming it will be to fix them. This will cost you precious time, and will probably leave you with a headache too.

### Your project is easier accessible to all sorts of devices and people. 

One of the things that you'll hear developers says is that the internet is a mess. Everybody is free to create en structure code the way they see fit. However, this does not mean that every webpage will perform the way you expect. While browsers that are rendering these pages are getting better and smarter by the day, they do follow certain webstandards to properly understand and display your webpage. Writing semantically incorrect code can lead to all sorts of accessibility problems, which you want to avoid at all times.

### Take disabilities into consideration

Styling divs as buttons or other semantically incorrect stuff might make sense to you because it looks and behaves exactly the same as a regular button element. This is because the div is tailored to what we see with our eyes; not what a computer understands. A computer isn't able to see that that a div is styled as a button. And say, a person that has visual impairments relies on your content being semantically correct. If not, his screenreader is not able to proper structure and understand your page. It would be hard to navigate through, and content would probably not be in the right oreder. Just because you are being lazy, you are making other peoples life harder. And that is something you should take into account.

### Always avoid learning things the wrong way

One of the most important traits of a developer is his or her ability to learn. Developers have to rely on their own discipline and willingness to learn to grow. But just willingness and discipline to do something is not enough. You have to discipline yourself to do things the right way from the start. Say you are learning a new language and you want it to make it do something. However, it doesn't do what you expect it to do. You then start to fiddle with it and add unnecesary code. In the end you might end up with sometyhing that works, but you will have never learnt why it did not do what you wanted it to do in the first place. After a while, you will notice that what you have been doing was very wrong, and your code might leads to some serieus bugs. Now you have to go back and change you code to get it right. If you would have spend some time to get it right in the first place, you could have started to apply it the right way and learn how to even better use that correct bit of code. Learning it the wrong way will make a lot of your "progress" redundant, and sets you back right at the start.

### Concluding

Even though you think writing semantically incorrect code from time to time might do no harm, it is allways better to avoid it at all times. Not only will it make you a better developer, it will help you improve somedbodies quality of life, it will improve your learning path, it will save you time and you don't have to worry that your page might not be working because of _your_ code.
