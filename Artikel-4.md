# Why it is important to focus on core coding and programming languages without relying on libraries and frameworks

Libraries and frameworks have long existed in the world of coding and programming. They are incredible tools too boost productivity and give developers the tools to more quickly build more complex websites and webapps. As a starting developer, I too feel tempted to rush into Jquerry, Vue, React, Bootstrap and other libraries and frameworks that would quickly enable me to build more intrecate pages. However, I am glad to say that I have not yet used any of these. Mostly because i understand that getting into these libraries and frameworks would actually inhibit me more than it would get me further at this point. A core understanding of how HTML, CSS, Javascript and other coding and programming languages work and operate are much more benificial than just look up a bit of Jquerry online to automatically perform tasks that I would be unable to do otherwise.

## Processing it all

In the past few months I have been working hard on improving my Javascript, HTML and CSS skills. I often encountered problems that i had no clue on how to solve. Looking up my code obstacles on Google, Youtube or other mediums would give me all sorts of ways to overcoming these obstacles. At least 50% or more of these solutions would be some magical jQuerry function. Luckily i was restricted from using these solutions. I actually quite recently truly understood that most libraries and frameworks were just constructs of often pure Javascript that would hand me coiled together functions to perform certain tasks. It was also quite a surprise that anything you can do with a library or framework, you can also do with pure Javascript. 

Because of this, I now understand the value of learning the core first. What is the challenge or pride in using readymade functions found online when you don't even know what is happening what is happening at its core. Not only do I find greater challenge in first becoming adept with core and basic coding and programming, I also understand that it is the key to sustainable growth in learning how to code. 

## A framework author's case against frameworks

Not too long ago I found a video of an actual Framework author who made a case _against_ using libraries and frameworks. In a clever way he made very clear why it make you a beter developer to think more rationally of frameworks and libraries. And above all, it would give you more peace of mind. Which I think is a very good case against frameworks. Being a developer in 2018 requires a lot of learning. And you will never be able to lear everything there is. The developing landscape is changing by the year, with frameworks and libraries popping up around every corener. 

Adrian Holovaty, who is the creator of the Django framework written in Python, is the person making this interesting case. He spoke at the DotJS conference in Paris, where he made clever references to what it feels like being a developer in 2018. He spoke of Frameworks and libraries being attack choppers that would swoop in and knock you off your feet. React beeing the newest meaty attack chopper with Vue hot on is heals.

He goes on making his case by giving some insight in how it was creating and eventually maintaining Django. At first he created the framework for himself because he wanted to fix a couple of shortcommings of Python. Soon, others started his small framework too. Within a couple of years it had grown to a massive following, and a more and more bloaty framework. Continously he would receive emails from developers that were running into problems that Adrian tried to sought fixes for. But every fix bloated the codebase more and more, and eventually fixes were needed to make other fixes compatible with fixes, and Adrian realized that it was starting to becme a mess. He then understood how these framework should not become a dependency that developers could or needed to rely on. 

## There is a middleground

While frameworks and libraries are powerfull tools that can empower a webdeveloper, it should not become something that the developer needs to rely on. Instead a developer needs to find a middleground where libraries and libraries and frameworks are used with rationality. There is always a possibility where support for a framework or library becomes deprecated and falls away. If you are able to build a core understanding of the code language and the code that you are using you always have a safety net. That being yourself.
